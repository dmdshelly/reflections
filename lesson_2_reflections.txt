What happens when you initialize a repository?  Why do you need to do it?
	creates the .git file that will track the commits

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository?  What value do you think it offers?
	staging area lets you get things ready before committing.  I think the working directory is the list of files included in the repository.
