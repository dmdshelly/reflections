When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
  Probably for group projects

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
	Someone could add something to the remote that you don't want.  Manual updating gives you more control over quality.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches.  When would you use one instead of another?
	branches - offshoots of a code base, the code base being the master branch
	clones - copies on your local computer of a branch of code (originating from GitHub or your local computer)
	forks - copies on GitHub of another branch of code on GitHub

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote stored locally?
	so can tell what changes have been made locally and on the remote since the last time they were synced

How would you collaborate without using Git or GitHub?  What would be easier, and what would be harder?
	comparing line by line - time intensive
	other version control systems?

When would you want to make changes in a separate branch rather than directly in master? What benefits does each approach have?
	when you need approval from someone else
	master is much less complicated, but using a branch makes sure you don't ruin master
